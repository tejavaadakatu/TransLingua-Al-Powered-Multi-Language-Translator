##  How to Run the Project

### 1️. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejavaadakatu/TransLingua-Al-Powered-Multi-Language-Translator.git
```
2. Create virtual environment (one time)
```bash
python -m venv venv310
```
3. Activate virtual environment
```bash
venv310\Scripts\activate
```
 You’ll see (venv) in terminal — that means it worked 

4.  Install dependencies (VERY IMPORTANT)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Do this once after activating venv)

5. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run translang.py
```
OR (safer version, always works):
```bash
python -m streamlit run translang.py
```

he TransLingua AI-Powered Language Translator is deployed and accessible online.
## Security Practices

API keys are stored securely using environment variables

.env and venv folders are excluded using .gitignore

No sensitive or personal information is uploaded to GitHub

## Use Cases

Global business communication

Academic research collaboration

Travel and tourism assistance

Language learning support

## Conclusion

TransLingua demonstrates how Generative AI can be effectively used to overcome language barriers through a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web application.
This project reflects real-world AI integration and follows best practices suitable for academic and internship evaluation.
